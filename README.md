# Maze-Generation
This project generates mazes using a variety of algorithms. The creation and completion of the maze is displayed using a GUI

Credit for the design and inspiration for this project goes to Daniel Shiffman (https://youtu.be/HyK_Q5rrcr4)

Credit for the general structure of algorithms goes to Jamis Buck.
The same algorithms written and implemented in Ruby can be found at: http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap

Here are some general explanations of each algorithm

Random Walkers:

	Aldous Broder - One of the simplest algorithms to implement. It simply starts at a random cell in the maze and chooses a random neighbor to move to. If the random neighbor has not been visited, it removes the wall between the current cell and the neighbor. Once each cell has been visited, the maze in complete.
