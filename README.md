# Maze-Generation
This project generates mazes using a variety of algorithms. The creation and completion of the maze is displayed using a GUI

Credit for the design and inspiration for this project goes to Daniel Schiffman (https://youtu.be/HyK_Q5rrcr4)

Credit for general structure of algorithms goes to Jamis Buck
The same algorithms written and implemented in Ruby can be found at: http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap
